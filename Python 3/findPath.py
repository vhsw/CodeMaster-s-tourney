# You are given an n Ã— m matrix, which contains all the integers from 1 to n * m, inclusive, each exactly once.
# Initially you are standing in the cell containing the number 1. On each turn you are allowed to move to an adjacent cell, 
# i.e. to a cell that shares a common side with the one you are standing on now. It is prohibited to visit any cell more than once.
# Check if it is possible to visit all the cells of the matrix in the order of increasing numbers in the cells,
# i.e. get to the cell with the number 2 on the first turn, then move to 3, etc.
