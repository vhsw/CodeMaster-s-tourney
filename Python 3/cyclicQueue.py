# You are working with a machine that resembles a queue. It supports two operations: add an element to the back of the queue and remove an element from the front of the queue. The machine recognizes the following commands:
# 
# "+N" (N â‰¥ 0) - add N to the back of the queue;
# "-" - remove an element from the front of the queue.
# Given an array of commands, return an array of sums of all elements in the queue after each operation the machine performs.
# 
# It is guaranteed that the second type operation is never applied to an empty queue. Sum of an empty queue is equal to 0.
# It is guaranteed that each command is recognizable by the machine.
# It is also guaranteed that the queue will not have more than 10 elements in it at any moment.
