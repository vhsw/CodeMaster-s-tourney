# We call an element of an array its peak if the array is strictly
# increasing on the left side of the peak and strictly decreasing on its right side.
# So if we have an array called sequence of length n, sequence[k] is a peak if and only if
# sequence[0] < sequence[1] < ... < sequence[k] and
# sequence[k] > sequence[k + 1] > ... > sequence[n - 1]
# Knowing that sequence definitely has a peak and that the peak is not its first
# or last element, find the peak's value.
